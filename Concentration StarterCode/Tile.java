 * In this version, a tile contains a card, similar to a playing card. Cards
 * have string values for their "face up" and "face down" state. Each tile
 * is shown face up or face down on the board.
 * 
 * A tile can also have a "cardMatched", indicateing the card has been matched
 * with another card and has been removed from the board. We use this value 
 * instead of a blank value or a missing tile because it helps to represent
 * the m x n game board when tiles would otherwise be blank or missing.
